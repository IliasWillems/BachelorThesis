    It is no exaggeration to state that least squares regression has been, and continues to be, one of the crown jewels of statistics. However, it is not a silver bullet for all problems: sometimes it lacks the necessary prediction power or cannot be computed at all. In these cases other methods are required. In this paper we introduce, motivate and explain ridge and Lasso estimation and provide a comparison between the two by applying them on a data set, as well as a comparison between them and regular least squares regression. For the comparison, we use a technique called Cross-Validation, which we will also explain in detail.
