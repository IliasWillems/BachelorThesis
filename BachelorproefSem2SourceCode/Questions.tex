\section*{Questions}
\begin{itemize}
    \item Should the abstract come before or after the table of contents?
    \item How should we structure the paper? Is it ok as it is now or should we move Sections 2 and 3 into the introduction?
    \item Using the function \textit{G,LMnet} in R, the intercept changes as $\lambda$ is varied. Why is this the case? The calculation of the intercept in the books is done by $\frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N y_i$, which is independent of $\lambda$.
    \item What is the $R^2$ test statistic and where is it used?
    \item Is this source~\cite{Kj2018} okay? --> find book
\end{itemize}
